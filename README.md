# Japience Frontend

Japience Frontend is a premium learning interface for Japanese study — designed to feel calm, modern, and structured. It blends a clean SaaS‑grade layout with language‑first UX: focused reading space, soft hierarchy, and responsive interaction patterns that help users study without distraction.

## What It Delivers

- A unified learning flow across grammar, vocabulary, AI practice, and Kanji mapping.
- Real‑time conversational UI with speech input and streaming responses.
- A Kanji experience with on/kun readings, Vietnamese meanings, furigana examples, audio samples, and a radical relationship map.
- A scalable architecture that keeps features isolated yet consistent.

## Technology Overview

Japience FE is built on a modern, production‑grade stack with strict type safety and a clean system design:

- **Next.js App Router** for file‑based routing and server/client composition.
- **TypeScript (strict)** for end‑to‑end type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS + Material UI** for fast layout + refined component styling.
- **Zustand** for predictable client state.
- **TanStack Query** for server data + caching.
- **ESLint + Prettier** for consistent code quality.

## Design Intent

Japience FE is intentionally minimal yet expressive: it emphasizes readability, smooth rhythm, and consistent visual language, while allowing deep study features to scale over time.
